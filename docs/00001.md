This exercise demonstrates the use of comments in Rust and performs some basic mathematical calculations.

Rust supports two main types of comments:
- Line comments: `// This is a line comment`
- Block comments: `/* This is a block comment */`

The code calculates the area and volume of a rectangular prism.
