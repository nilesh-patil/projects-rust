This exercise focuses on determining if a number is prime and finding all prime numbers up to a given limit (`N`).

Key functions:
- `is_prime(n: i32) -> bool`: Checks if a given integer `n` is a prime number.
  - Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
  - It iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it's not prime.
- `primes_up_to(n: i32) -> Vec<i32>`: Returns a vector containing all prime numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive).

The `main` function demonstrates the usage by finding primes up to `1,000,000`.
